REST Assured API test automation of LMS preproduction USER, Skill and Skill MAP API's

# LMS RESTAPI
 LMS API REST Assured Automation Testing

# Prerequisites/Development Environment
Following software should be installed in the system.
Java 8 & above <br /> Maven <br /> Postgres 14 <br /> Eclipse IDE

Application setup- To run LMS API service
Step 1: Run and setup Postgre <br /> Step 2: Check Postgres DB(assuming Postgres DB setup is in place) connectivity with username=postgres, password=admin <br /> Step 3: If your your DB not setup please follow LMSDB_RestorationGuide.docx and restore LMS_DB.tar. <br /> Step 4: Run LMS API Jar file (LMS_API-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) <br /> Step 5: Download LMS_API-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar <br /> Step 6: Run command prompt from source folder of jar file C:/< path for jar folder> java -jar LMS_API-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Step 7: To confirm LMS API service is up and running open the POSTMAN/Swagger and test the application. <br /> POSTMAN : https://springboot-lms-userskill.herokuapp.com/Users <br /> Swagger: https://springboot-lms-userskill.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html

# To Run the REST assured Automation from Eclipse: <br />
Step 1: Follow steps 1- 7 as mentioned in the above section. <br /> Step 2 : Download code from Git, import into eclipse as Maven project and build the project so automatically install all needed dependencies. <br /> Step 2A: Run the TestRunner file for Positive Scenarios (smoke cases) <br />  Step 2B: Run the TestRunner file for Negative Scenarios <br /> Step 3 : Find reports under Reports folder in project

# Assumptions
We have two sequences user_seq for USER_ID of TBL_LMS_USER Format – U{XX}, initialized with 01 <br />

user_skill_seq for USER_SKILL_ID of TBL_LMS_USERSKILL_MAP Format – US{XX}, initialized with 01
<br />
***** Above these two customized sequences are using spring boot SequenceStyleGenerator. ***** It is advisable that the related tables should be empty, and the sequences values should be generated from 01. If some records are already present in the table, then execution will throw primary key violation constraint exception. So in order to resolve the issue sequence need to be reset to the (max+1) value for that primary key column. Below sqls need to be executed multiple times until respective sequences equal to the max value of that respective primary key column. select nextval ('user_seq') For example, let us assume that USER table has already 5 records and max value of USER_ID is ‘U05’. So, the above sql needs to be executed manually 5 times. So next time if your run the application spring boot will insert ‘U06’ value to USER_ID.
 <br />
select nextval (' user_skill_seq ') Same logic for this sequence also.
